How does app.js load vs public scripts
Best way to go about random search api
Best way to go about limiting fetch requests. Cache requests? Is that worth it? Save this where (client vs server)? Depends how app.js is loaded and variables saved. Dont want to limit random search api. can save offset and query string in the cache to prevent that
Spofity API has rate limiting, doubt ill get anywhere near this but I am making excessive calls

Should I send entire spotify API track response to database so I will have acces to evertything or create my own object. Will be useful to have access to everything if I scope change. Probably best to do this.
How to save audio files. just save the link and create new audio objects or save actual 'new Audio' object in the db (dont think this is worth)? audio objects saved on front end, then these are cleared when cliet disconnects???




GAME OPTIONS
Can manipulate the audio object for each game.
Can speed up, slow down, play snippets. 0.2 and 2.8 seem reasonable for playbacks
Want to play reverse but 'HTMLMediaElement': The provided playback rate (-1) is not in the supported' error in browser. Need another way to reverse


PLAYLIST MODEL FRAMEWORK
creator ID: user object id
tracks[]: list of track objects from js api in playlist
type: 'fast/slow/snippet/reverse


FRONT END
handles creation of audio html objects
implements volume, warping for game type (speedin up/slowing down/snippets)
on creation of play buttons need to add listener to play correct audio object
iterate over songs in playlist, create html element, create audio object, assign audio 
object to html objects event listener > this best done with a class constructor like I did the nodes in tic-tac-toe??
